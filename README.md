# Engage Frontend
Engage is a tool that lets you easily follow issues your city council is debating. More importantly, it provides a platform for expressing your views on these issues, in a way that you know will be heard by your city.

## Stack
The frontend part of the Engage is powered by [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), and [Semantic UI React](https://react.semantic-ui.com/). 

## Contributing
