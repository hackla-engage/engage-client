          <p>
            People often never get a chance to speak at a city council meeting. There are many
            causes for this: work schedules, childcare, accessibility, they've thought their voice
            would not be heard, or they just haven't followed an issue in detail.
          </p>
          <p>
            Engage is a tool that lets you easily follow issues your city council is debating. More
            importantly, it provides a platform for expressing your views on these issues, in a way
            you know will be heard by your city.

          <p>
            Engage’s mission is to empower citizens to improve their local government by making it
            easy to participate in discussions on government policy and agendas. We hope to make a
            solution that works for all local governments, but for now are starting with the city of
            Santa Monica.
          </p>

            We are nearing launch on our pilot app for Santa Monica - please check back soon for
