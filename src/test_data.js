          "Executive Summary",
          "The Facilities Maintenance Division contracts out heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) work for various City facilities including City Hall, the Public Safety Facility, City libraries and City fire stations. This contracted work augments the City’s in-house HVAC staff and generally focuses on large scale repairs and maintenance of intricate HVAC systems. Staff recommends piggybacking off of a competitive bid completed by the Big Blue Bus (BBB) last year and awarding the contract to ACCO Engineered Systems for an amount not to exceed $1,499,064 over a five-year period.",
          "Background",
          "In June 2017, Facilities Maintenance staff awarded informal bid 53907-OG to ACCO Engineered Systems. Staff executed a contractual services agreement, CT-4395, for a total amount not to exceed $175,000 over a two-year period. Upon the execution of CT-4395, it became apparent that the total not to exceed amount would be exhausted in less than two years as the City’s demand for HVAC contractual services has increased due to the addition of facilities at the Santa Monica Municipal Airport and aging HVAC systems citywide.",
          "Discussion",
          "The City employs five permanent in-house staff to provide various HVAC services at City facilities. Typical services provided by City staff include adjusting air controls, changing fan belts and providing basic preventative maintenance. Due to the large size and complexity of some City HVAC systems, in-house staff cannot meet all citywide HVAC needs. To ensure efficient operation and safe temperature-controlled environments for the public and staff, additional services are contracted out for:",

          "· large-scale projects that are often long-term and require specialized licensing and equipment; and",
          "· addressing equipment failures and emergency repair work in a timely manner to prevent shutdowns.",
          "Immediate contracted services are needed to address a backlog of deferred maintenance which will require significant repairs and replacements to various City HVAC systems. Internal staff will then be able to take on most preventative maintenance throughout the City. The installation of new equipment will also reduce the demand for contractors to complete repairs.",
          "Staff expects to complete the large-scale projects during the first two years of the contract in an amount not to exceed $850,000, for a total amount not to exceed $1,075,000 over a five-year period. Citywide routine preventative maintenance will be performed during the first two years of the contract in an amount not to exceed $164,350, for a total amount not to exceed $424,064 over a five-year period.",
          "Staff recommends piggybacking on BBB’s bid award with ACCO Engineered Systems, at the same hourly rate, in an amount not to exceed $1,014,350 for two years, with one additional three-year renewal option, for a total amount not to exceed $1,499,064 over a five-year period, with future year funding contingent on Council budget approval.",

The bid was posted on the City’s online bidding site, and notices were advertised in the Santa Monica Daily Press in accordance with City Charter and Municipal Code provisions. Twenty-seven vendors downloaded the bid. Two bids were received and publicly opened on April 6, 2017 (Attachment A). ACCO Engineered Systems and Richardson Technologies, Inc. submitted bids, and highlights from each are as follows:",
          "Bids were evaluated based on criteria in SMMC 2.24.072, including price, previous experience, ability to deliver, quality of product, and compliance with City specifications. ACCO Engineered Systems, the lowest bidder, was recommended as the best bidder.",
          "On June 13, 2017 Council awarded bid #4266 for the maintenance and repair of HVAC systems to ACCO Engineered Systems (Attachment A). Staff recommends piggybacking on BBB’s bid award with ACCO Engineered Systems, at the same hourly rate. The proposed agreement with ACCO Engineered Systems fully complies with the exceptions to competitive bidding, pursuant to Section 2.24.080(b) of the Santa Monica Municipal Code.",
          "Financial Impacts and Budget Actions",
          "The agreement to be awarded to ACCO Engineered Systems is for an amount not to exceed $1,499,064. Funds of $506,330 are available in the FY 2017-18 budget in the Public Works Department. The contract will be charged to account 01274.570060 and expenditures will be transferred to departments incurring the contracting services.

          "Executive Summary",
          "In response to community and broader concerns raised by media reports, the City of Santa Monica commissioned an independent compensation study to collect and analyze pay, benefits and workload data from comparable cities and, where appropriate, the private sector to identify opportunities for improvement of policies and practices related to City employee compensation, as well as analyze use of overtime by public safety staff. The report represents one of the most comprehensive local government analyses of compensation practices done in recent years in Southern California, comparing not only pay, benefits and public safety overtime usage, but benchmarking workload data and other factors among cities comparable to Santa Monica. The report documents that overall, Santa Monica’s pay and benefits are comparable to peer cities, albeit on the higher end of the scale. Also noted is the large scope and high level of City services. The report also identifies areas for improvement, many of which are already in progress. Implementation of these improvements will play a significant role in the City’s efforts to maintain fiscal sustainability as it faces future statewide threats from rising pension costs.",
          "The Compensation and Staffing Review report (Attachment A) was conducted by the City’s internal auditor, Moss Adams, LLP, under the oversight of the Audit Subcommittee of the City Council, with advisory support from a limited-term, seven‑member ad hoc committee of residents, the Compensation Study Advisory Committee (CSAC). The report provides 13 observations and recommendations organized in the following categories: wage and benefits packages, drivers of compensation, and public safety overtime.",
          "The report was informed by interviews of eleven peer cities, published data and surveys and interviews of staff and labor unions.",
          "Background",
          "On January 17, 2017, in response to concerns raised by a number of community groups related to news stories about City of Santa Monica staff compensation, and calls by these groups that an “independent” audit be conducted, the Audit Subcommittee discussed a proposed scope of work for a compensation audit to be completed by the independent firm that acts as the City’s Internal Auditor, Moss Adams, LLP.",
          "After initial discussions both in the Audit Subcommittee and among community members and the City Manager, staff returned to the Audit Subcommittee on April 20, 2017 with an amended and expanded scope of work, along with the recommendation to create an ad hoc advisory committee, composed of up to 7 community members. According to the resolution establishing this ad-hoc community committee would act “in an advisory capacity to the Audit Subcommittee in matters pertaining to critically reviewing and objectively considering the City's methodologies related to compensation.” The ad-hoc community committee was to join Subcommittee discussions specifically related to the scope, findings, and final report of the compensation review. At its May 9, 2017 meeting (Attachment B), Council directed the City Manager to seek applications from members of the public who would be interested in serving on the ad hoc committee, named the Compensation Study Advisory Committee (CSAC), and then make appointments.On August 23, the Audit Subcommittee, informed by its discussion with members of CSAC, approved the scope of work for the Compensation and Staffing Review. The Audit Subcommittee and CSAC reviewed data and an initial draft of the report, asked questions and discussed additional information that would be useful to incorporate into the report on November 21, 2017 and February 28, 2018. The final report was received and reviewed by the Audit Subcommittee at its meeting on April 17, 2018. Also received and filed at the April 17, 2018 meeting was an implementation plan proposing steps that staff could take to address report recommendations.",

          "The report was informed by interviews of eleven peer cities: Anaheim, Beverly Hills, Burbank, Culver City, El Segundo, Glendale, Inglewood, Pasadena, Redondo Beach, Santa Barbara and Torrance. Berkeley and Palo Alto also participated in interviews to provide perspectives on leading practices in other innovative, progressive cities published data and surveys and interviews. This was in addition to interviews with staff and labor unions.  After discussions between the Audit Subcommittee and the CSAC the scope and peer cities were approved by the Audit Subcommittee.",
          "While the report indicates that every effort was made to obtain comparable data, not all information can be compared equally. Factors that contribute to this include differences in operating budgets, performance measurements, community priorities, level of outsourcing, geography, and departmental organization. Additionally, a large part of the peer information used in this report is self-reported and un-audited. Cities do not, as a general practice, gather and make public easily comparable data on compensation, workload and service levels on a consistent basis.",

When Santa Monica’s median cash compensation was compared to peers, it was the third lowest, likely due to the City’s strong preference to insource services that require a large number of relatively low paid workers. For individual positions, Santa Monica met or fell below the peer median for 40% of the positions included in the benchmarking study, while the remaining 60% of positions were compensated at levels exceeding the peer median.

          "8",
          "Observation",
          "Santa Monica largely operated as usual during the 2008 recession and did not need to reduce staffing levels, while most peer cities had to significantly cut costs by increasing efficiency, outsourcing services, and reducing staffing levels.",

          "13",
          "Observation",
          "Although SMFD’s overtime expenditures increased by approximately $800,000 between FY 2014 and FY 2016, the overtime rate for an existing employee costs an estimated 9.3% less to 6.5% more than the hourly rate of a new employee, suggesting that the use of overtime may provide cost savings to the department.",
          "Recommendation",
          "In accordance with best practice, conduct a staffing study to evaluate on-duty staffing demand, staffing levels, and use of overtime.",
          "Some key points emerged from the study that highlight the unique landscape in which Santa Monica functions. According to the study, “Santa Monica’s community has a number of unique characteristics compared to the average municipality.” Specifically, the population fluctuates substantially from day to night, seasonally, and during the holidays. These fluctuations impact the City’s public safety, public landscape and transit services. It has more complex processes for planning and development due to its “unique environmental considerations and community development priorities. Overall, the City delivers programs and services beyond a typical full-service city, including infrastructure (airport, pier, cemetery, public Wi-Fi, community broadband, beach, regional bus service) and community programs (arts and community non-profit grant programs, housing assistance, public interest law, mobility).” (p. 8)",
          "Additionally, among peers, Santa Monica shares a reputation, with Palo Alto and Berkeley, as “‘innovation labs’ of local government in California, because they have the employees, culture and resources to explore innovative programming and services.” As noted in the study, “Both cities reported that, similar to Santa Monica, the culture of high levels of service was driven by the community, elected officials and employees… City leadership reported that new hires typically have more experience and education than a typical new hire.” These cities “noted their highly engaged and educated communities, with long public meetings and significant effort made to quickly respond to citizen requests. Several peer cities reported a perception that their public meetings are not as long as Santa Monica’s, nor do they require as much staff time to support.” (p.46)",
          "Comparison to Peers",
          "Santa Monica’s cash compensation is comparable to the average of peer cities. (pp. 17, 21) By virtue of the fact that Santa Monica shares a regional economy and statewide structures (such as being a member of the California Public Employee Retirement System - CalPERS) with its peers, its compensation is driven by many of the same factors and is for the most part comparable. As noted in the study, the region has a high cost of living (the study refers to Santa Monica’s over $1 million median home price as the second highest among the peer group and far above the $465,000 of the Los Angeles metro area (p.8), high commute times, and high job competition, including with the private sector).",
          "Overall, the City’s median cash compensation for individual positions met or fell below the peer median for 40% of positions analyzed, while 60% of the positions were above the peer median. Like all but one peer city, Santa Monica’s employees are hired, promoted and compensated according to the statutes of the City’s civil service system as defined in the City Charter and Municipal Code and overseen by a Personnel Board whose members are appointed by the City Council. Nine of the eleven peers, including Santa Monica, showed high employee tenure. According to the study, the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that local government employee tenure is 8.3 years, while the private sector median is 3.7 years. Longer tenure is noted as a factor in higher total compensation costs. (p. 44)",
          "The proportional mix of salaries, medical and retirement benefit costs is similar across the peer cities, with Santa Monica having slightly higher (1-3%) medical costs. (pp. 12-13) All cities have seen steep increases in medical insurance costs in recent years. Most peer cities face the challenge of large unfunded pension liabilities. While some cities seem to have lower liability burdens as a percent of their operating budget, four of these cities operate electrical utilities and their budgets include large contracts for electrical purchases, which affects the proportional distribution of these costs.",
          "Facing the same fiscal challenges related to medical and retirement costs, Santa Monica and its peers are requiring employees to increase their cost sharing of retirement and medical contributions. Santa Monica, like four peers, has added additional, lower levels of retirement benefits for non-sworn new hires that go beyond the legislatively-mandated reduced levels (commonly referred to as tiers). The following chart shows the different level of pension benefits and the percentage of the City’s workforce in these tiers of retirement:",

Santa Monica has gone a step further than its peers, in accordance with its Council-adopted policy, to pay down at least $1.2 million of its unfunded liability each year in addition to making its regular pension contribution payments. Additionally, the City has taken the bold step to aggressively pay down the unfunded liability by making significant lump sum payments. To date, the City has made $76 million in additional payments to lower its unfunded pension liability.",
          "The study found a number of areas where Santa Monica differs from peers. The report indicates these differences are often the result of the unique circumstances of Santa Monica and can represent areas for improvement.",
          "· Santa Monica has the highest median cash compensation for management positions.",
          "The data and anecdotal research suggests that the higher median is due, in part, to Santa Monica’s desire to take on complex issues and to be a leader in local government innovation, similar to the cities of Palo Alto and Berkeley, requiring staff with more experience and education. (p.46)",
          "· Santa Monica has the largest staff of peer cities, and often has a higher workload.",
          "The report indicates that Santa Monica has unique services including a cemetery, pier, airport, public Wi-Fi, community broadband, beach, regional bus line, Office of Sustainability, Office of Civic Wellbeing, as well as social services and arts grant programs. Santa Monica has a population that fluctuates from 92,289 to 250,000 on a daily and seasonal basis and this larger population directly impacts public safety, public landscape/beach, and transit services. Also factoring into the larger staff is Council’s policy of insourcing and keeping a low level of as-needed positions, rather than contracting out. Examples of areas that other cities contract out are solid waste, custodial, and workers’ compensation.",
          "· Some trade and frontline positions are paid less than peers.",
          "The difference in cash compensation is likely due to the City’s in-sourcing of many services, which may lower the minimum value of the range. (p. 17)",
          "· Staff increased 5% in 9 years, while peer cities, whose revenues were more impacted during the Great Recession, laid off or furloughed staff or froze salaries.",
          "The majority of recent position increases in Santa Monica were related to the introduction of EXPO light rail service (specifically additional Police and Fire personnel, and additional positions in BBB as part of the Evolution of Blue enhancements), changing service structures at the Santa Monica Airport (these positions have not been filled), as well as the conversion of as-needed positions to permanent positions.",
          "Implementation Plan",

          "Executive Summary",
          "After extensive planning and public approval milestones, construction is set to commence on a replacement for the City’s downtown fire station which does not meet current seismic and other contemporary operating standards. Staff recommends that the City Council and Public Financing Authority (PFA) approve documents required for the issuance of Lease Revenue Bonds, Series 2018 to finance Fire Station No. 1 and a Fire Training Facility at the City Yards. The determination to issue lease revenue bonds is made based on the City’s intent to distribute the cost of building an essential facility over its useful life, the City’s access to low-cost financing, and the City’s low level of existing debt.",
          "The Bonds will be secured by a lease agreement between the City and the PFA that will include the right to use the City’s Public Safety Facility during Fire Station No. 1 construction, following which lease payments will be for Fire Station No. 1 use and occupancy only. Bond proceeds will also cover bond issuance costs. The proposed Series 2018 bonds will be for a maximum principal amount of $38,000,000, with a final maturity date of July 1, 2048 and a maximum true interest cost of 5.00%.",

          "On March 27, 2018 (Attachment I), Council authorized the City Manager to negotiate and execute a contract with Bernards Bros., Inc. in the amount of $29.2 million for construction of Fire Station No. 1. Additionally, the Fire Station No. 1 project will include approximately $12.4 million in direct owner costs for technology equipment, testing and inspections, construction management services, permits, fees, furniture, fixtures and equipment, LEED certification costs, and project contingency. The cost of the Fire Training Facility is estimated to be approximately $2.2 million.",
          "Discussion",
          "Staff is recommending that the City issue lease revenue bonds in an amount not to exceed $38.0 million to fund the Fire Station No. 1 and Fire Training Facility projects. The remaining costs will be paid for by $6.5 million in reserves previously set aside for the projects. When determining whether to issue bonds to cover this capital cost, the City has considered a number of factors. First, the City’s adopted financial policies assert the prudence of using debt financing to distribute the cost of a facility over its useful life. Also, owing to its sound financial health and resulting high credit ratings, the City is able to benefit from low-cost financing. This allows for greater flexibility in allocating existing resources. Finally, the City is able to take advantage of favorable conditions in the municipal bond market due to its very low level of debt. With regard to the last factor, the City’s indebtedness is limited by Article VI of the City Charter, which states that the bonded indebtedness of the City may not exceed the sum of 10% of the total assessed valuation of property within the City. With this bond issuance, staff estimates that this indicator would reach 0.50%.",

A negotiated sale, as compared to an open competitive bid, is the best way to ensure the bond underwriter is in compliance with the City’s banking services Resolution (Resolution No. 11025). Upon Council approval of the Series 2018 Bond issuance, the City’s financial advisor will assist staff in determining the fair market value for the Bond interest rates.",
          "To select a bond underwriter, the City’s financial advisor distributed a Request for Qualifications (“RFQ”) to 12 commercial and investment banking institutions active in the California tax-exempt bond market. The RFQ required respondents to certify the firm was in compliance with the City’s banking services Resolution. Nine firms responded to the RFQ.  The financial advisor rated the firms based on a combination of factors including their recommended approach to the bond sale, relevant experience with similar financings, methodology to execute the bond sale, compensation, and compliance with City social responsibility guidelines per Resolution 11025.  The recommendations were then presented to Finance Department staff who made the final selection of Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. as lead manager and UBS as co-manager. The lead manager serves as the representative of the underwriting group and manages the process of soliciting orders for the bonds from individual and institutional investors. The co-manager assumes underwriting liability and consults with the lead manager prior to and during the financing process.",

A total of 21 vendors downloaded the bid. Three bids were received and publicly opened on February 1, 2018, per Attachment B. Bids were evaluated based on the criteria in SMMC 2.24.072, including price, quality of products quoted and compliance with City specifications. There were 16 sample items quoted for bid and each vendor had multiple items for which they were the lowest bidder. Electric Supply Connection is the lowest bidder on 5 of the items and second lowest on an additional 5 items. Its store location is less than two miles from the City Yards (2500 Michigan Avenue), where the Facilities Maintenance and Street and Fleet Services workshops are located. The other two bidders’ closest store locations are 32 miles (Summers Group) and 17 miles (Wesco Distribution) from the City Yards, which would effectively prohibit the necessary in-store purchases. Moreover, Electric Supply Connection is the only bidder to offer four renewal options. If taken as an average across all bid line items, there was a 13% increase in the prices quoted above those of Summers Group, but staff determined that this offset was justified given the staff time required to travel to Santa Fe Springs for supplies. Based on these criteria, staff recommends Electric Supply Connection as the best bidder.",

Since the 1990’s, Big Blue Bus (BBB) has been a leader in using cost efficient environmentally-friendly vehicle propulsion technology for its fixed route bus fleet. With the advent of new propulsion technology being tested and evaluated at many California transit agencies and the potential that the California Air Resources Board (ARB) proposed Innovative Clean Transit (ICT) regulation being finalized later this year, staff initiated an analysis to compare the economic and environmental benefits for future vehicle procurements under two propulsion scenarios: 1)transitioning BBB’s existing fleet to near-zero NOx emission (NZE) natural gas engines that would continue to be fueled by renewable natural gas (RNG); and, 2)transitioning BBB’s existing fleet to battery electric buses (BEB).",
          "Staff is committed to providing an objective and unbiased approach to help guide Council, and while the GNA report summary and cost implications for each fuel path are provided in the staff report, there are inherent tradeoffs with each fuel path scenario, upsides to each, and unknowns with Scenario Number 2, (transition the fleet to BEBs) due to how new this technology is in the transit industry. At the end of the day, BBB is committed to consistently provide financially sustainable, efficient, effective and safe mobility services to our customers and the community on a daily basis.",

The fleet’s service area is vastly larger than the City’s municipal service boundary of 8.4 square miles.",

Approximately 60% of the fleet is model year 2011 or newer buses. The entire fleet is powered by natural gas engines fueled with renewable natural gas. Today, 62½ percent of the fleet operates on compressed natural gas (CNG) and 37.5% operates on liquefied natural gas (LNG). However, all LNG buses within the fleet would be retired by 2019.",

A private on-site station is located within the fenced boundary of the transit facility, while a public access station is located outside of the fenced boundary but still on BBB’s property. BBB’s transit fleet is supplied with CNG (via the LCNG station) and LNG from renewable liquefied natural gas (RLNG) that is procured from Clean Energy. On average, Clean Energy delivers one load of RLNG each day which is transported via tanker truck from Clean Energy’s Boron LNG plant.

On average, BBB’s electricity cost is higher than that of surrounding utility customers because the City procures a higher fraction of renewable electricity in its electricity mix than SCE’s average delivered electricity mix. The low carbon electricity is purchased via a third party energy service provider (ESP) but is delivered through SCE’s distribution system.",
          "During peak service days, which occur Monday through Friday, BBB’s fleet operates 240 daily weekday assignments which require 162 transit buses during peak weekday service. The average distance of an assignment is 71 miles; however, individual assignments range from 13 miles up to 181 miles. Some transit buses receive more than one assignment during a peak day. The majority of route operations occur on primarily flat surfaces, however, there are a small number of route assignments, such as those travelling to and from the Pacific Palisades area, that entail a significant amount of elevation change.",

          "Fuel Path Analysis",
          "To help staff better understand the issues surrounding vehicle propulsion systems, the consulting firm of Gladstein, Neandross & Associates/Ramboll prepared a detailed analysis looking at the different fuel paths. For each of the vehicle deployment scenarios, cost and emissions profiles were developed on a per-mile, annual, and lifecycle basis using fleet composition, operational, and procedural data provided by BBB, as well as assumptions where necessary in order to characterize the recently commercialized alternative technologies. The operational cost for each transit bus technology is an aggregate of individual cost factors that include bus capital, fuel, operations and maintenance (O&M), midlife overhaul, fuelling infrastructure, and facility modification costs. Data provided by BBB and assumptions were evaluated to quantify the individual cost factors as a component of the overall cost. The emissions evaluated as part of the analysis include greenhouse gases (GHGs), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), and particulate matter (PM10).",
          "The analysis found the total per-mile operational cost for BBB’s existing transit buses to be $2.789/mi compared to $2.829/mi for near-zero NOx emission natural gas transit buses and $4.054/mi for battery electric transit buses if purchased in 2017. While significant operating cost reductions are not expected for BBB’s existing buses or for NZE natural gas buses over the next 20 years, it is widely projected that operating costs for battery electric buses will fall over time.",
          "The analysis projects that battery electric buses purchased in 2030 would have an average operating cost of $3.382/mi. Over a 12-year lifecycle, the operational cost of BBB’s existing transit bus is approximately $1,079,343/bus compared to $1,094,823/bus for near-zero NOx emission transit buses, $1,568,898/bus for battery electric transit buses purchased in 2017, and $1,308,834/bus for battery electric buses purchased in 2030. This represents an incremental cost of $15,480/bus for near-zero NOx emission transit buses, $489,555/bus for battery electric transit buses purchased in 2017, and $229,491/bus for battery electric transit buses purchased in 2030. Estimated costs for battery electric transit buses take into account significant reductions in battery costs over time and are net of projected credits that BBB could generate under California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS).",
          "The emissions analysis found well-to-wheel (WTW) GHG emissions of BBB’s existing transit bus to be 1,475 grams per mile (g/mi) compared to 1,213 g/mi emitted from near-zero NOx transit buses, and 8.88 g/mi for battery electric transit buses purchased in 2017 and in 2030. Well-to-tank (WTT) NOx emissions were found to be 4.53 g/mi for BBB’s existing transit buses, 4.55 g/mi for near-zero NOx transit buses, and 0.0653 g/mi for battery electric transit buses purchased in 2017 and in 2030. Tank-to-wheel (TTW) NOx emissions were found to be 0.581 g/mi emitted by BBB’s existing transit buses compared to 0.045 g/mi emitted from near-zero NOx transit buses and 0.00 g/mi emitted from battery electric transit buses purchased in 2017 and in 2030.",

At an incremental cost of approximately $78 million, the transition of BBB’s existing fleet to battery electric transit buses would result in GHG and TTW NOx emissions reductions that are more costly compared to those achieved from the deployment of near-zero NOx emission natural gas transit buses.",
          "The results of the analysis are based on projections of significant operating cost reductions for battery electric buses over time. These reductions are based on large reductions in battery storage costs and projections of revenue from the LCFS program. Changes in these assumptions would have a dramatic impact on the total estimated project costs. Were battery storage costs to remain constant (and not fall over time as they almost certainly will based on history), the incremental cost of converting the entire fleet to battery electric buses would increase to approximately $130 million as opposed to approximately $78 million.",

Credits are generated from the use of low carbon fuels in the transportation sector. Regulated entities, such as petroleum refiners, are required to purchase credits to offset the GHG emissions associated with the higher carbon fuels that they produce. It is the demand for these credits by regulated entities that sets the credit price. Though the credit price has remained stable in recent years, future credit prices would be established in an open market environment and any fluctuations in the price of the credit would directly impact BBB’s cost of operating battery electric buses.",
          "Funding Opportunities",
          "With the proposed 23-year length of a transition to a zero emission fleet, it is impossible to accurately predict what the funding landscape would look like. However, this section describes existing federal, state, and county programs and incentives outside of BBB’s ongoing funding streams that could help pay for alternatively-fuelled buses.",
          "The Federal Transit Administration (FTA) offers two relatively small funding pots for the purchase of zero-emission transit buses. The Low or No Emission Competitive Program (LoNo) provides funding to state and local governmental authorities for the purchase or lease of zero-emission and low-emission transit buses as well as acquisition, construction, and leasing of required supporting facilities. The LoNo Program distributes $55 million nationwide. Big Blue Bus applied for funding for battery electric buses in the FTA’s last funding cycle but was not selected.",
          "The FTA also offers the Bus & Bus Facilities Infrastructure Investment Program which allows agencies to replace, rehabilitate and purchase buses and related equipment and to construct bus-related facilities including technological changes or innovations to modify low or no emission vehicles or facilities. The Bus and Bus Facilities Program distributes $226 million nationally. BBB currently submitted an application for the purchase of seven battery electric vehicles through this program but was not selected.",
          "The state’s funding opportunities for zero and near zero engines have been increasing in recent years. For example, the Hybrid and Zero-Emission Truck and Bus Voucher Incentive Project (HVIP) provides vouchers to help California fleets purchase advanced technology trucks and buses. HVIP provides vouchers for California purchasers and lessees of hybrid and zero-emission trucks and buses on a first-come, first-served basis. Purchasers of fixed route zero emission buses receive $110,000 per vehicle while using near zero engines receive $10,000 to offset costs. BBB would utilize these vouchers regardless of the fuel path chosen.",
          "To help with the implementation costs of the ICT regulation, the ARB has recently proposed to invest one-third of the VW Mitigation Trust in zero-emission buses. The program would create a maximum incentive of up to $180,000 for a new battery electric transit bus, up to $400,000 for a new fuel cell electric transit bus, and up to $100,000 for a new battery electric shuttle bus. These maximum funding amounts exceed the maximum funding amounts allowed under HVIP. Unfortunately, no funding is proposed for charging infrastructure.",
          "In January, the California Public Utility Commission (CPUC) approved the first transportation electrification applications under SB 350 from the three large investor-owned utilities. The decision approves 15 projects with combined budgets of $42 million statewide. One approved project in Southern California Edison’s (SCE) area is $3.9million for “Electric Transit Bus Make-Ready.” SCE would deploy make-ready infrastructure at bus depots and along bus routes to serve electric commuter buses operating in SCE’s service territory. SCE would also provide a rebate to participating customers to cover the cost of the charging equipment and installation. SCE would maximize the electric transit bus routes it supports in disadvantaged communities.",
          "The California State Transportation Agency has recently finished accepting applications for the next round of Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program (TIRCP). The TIRCP aims to increase ridership on the state-wide transit and rail network and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The five-year program is anticipated to distribute $2.4 billion. Big Blue Bus recently submitted a grant application to CALSTA asking for $3.05 million to pay for the incremental cost of ten 40-foot battery electric buses. The total cost of the ten vehicle program would be $9.7 million. Associated infrastructure costs were not included in the request in order to make the application more competitive.",
          "At the County level, BBB’s participation in Metro’s Bus Operations Subcommittee (BOS) allows it to apply for bus replacements and facility improvements. The BOS distributes 15% of Los Angeles County’s Federal 5307 Capital funds on an annual basis. Typically, the fund source spreads approximately $17 million among the sixteen Municipal Operators. The funds are allocated based on a competitive process.",
          "Context for All-Electric Fleet Conversion",
          "With over 200 public transit systems operating about 14,000 buses, the State of California is leading the way nationally in making the commitment to an all zero-emission fleet. Within the state, seven transit agencies have committed to making full transition to an all-electric fleet by the year 2030. LA Metro currently has 100 zero-emission vehicles on order, and has committed to the conversion if their new vehicles comply with performance benchmarks. Foothill Transit and the City of Los Angeles Department of Transportation (LADOT) have also made the same commitment to have an all zero-emission fleet by 2030. Foothill Transit has 30 zero-emission buses on the road; Long Beach Transit has 10. LADOT has four vehicles on the road and recently ordered 25 more zero emission vehicles. Antelope Valley Transit Authority (AVTA) has eight buses on the street and an order placed for all 85 of their buses to be battery electric by the end of 2019. Elsewhere in the United States, King County Metro in Seattle has committed to purchasing 120 all electric battery buses by 2020 with the goal of having a 100% zero emission fleet between 2034 and 2040.",
          "The number of manufacturers currently providing battery electric buses is limited but the number is growing as more transit systems commit to the new technology. Two battery electric only bus manufacturers - Proterra and BYD - currently sell most of the battery electric buses across the United States. Other legacy bus manufacturers such as New Flyer and Gillig are also entering the battery electric marketplace.",
          "The most exhaustive study of battery electric bus performance was completed in June 2017 by the US Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory on twelve Foothill Transit buses. The study compared the performance of Proterra battery electric buses versus Foothill's NABI CNG vehicles as a baseline. Highlights of the study include: the twelve battery electric buses accumulating more than 900,000 miles during the study period; the buses surpassed their target of 4,000 miles between road calls with more than 6,000 miles during the evaluation period; the on-route chargers operated reliably with minimal issues; and the high voltage batteries showed little to no sign of capacity degradation during the study period.",
          "Conversely, the short-range on-route charged buses are inflexible and cannot be deployed to other routes; the higher use of air conditioning lowers the effective range in hotter months; charger availability is needed for successful vehicle deployment; and the CNG buses did significantly outperform the battery electric bus in many of the evaluation areas. For comparison, BBB’s miles between road failures on the CNG and LNG fleets are more than 18,000 miles. Additionally, systems in Albuquerque, NM, and Long Beach have experienced significant delays in BEB deliveries from vendors, delaying new projects that both systems had intended to launch in early 2017.",
          "Based upon proactive discussions with Southern California Edison, and through staff evaluation of the proposed SCE medium- and heavy-duty vehicle charging infrastructure that includes transit agencies, staff has identified up to 23 potential charging unit locations within the maintenance/parking yard where BEBs could be charged overnight.",
          "BBB all-Electric Fleet Challenges",
          "One of the many challenges with converting the fleet to electric is operational and maintenance continuity of operations. As buses become eligible for replacement under the FTA funding regulations that BBB follows, transitioning and operating a dual fueled fleet becomes complex. During the conversion, more space would be needed for infrastructure required to support charging the BBB electric fleet, while still maintaining RNG fueling facilities for the CNG fleet including giving consideration to back-up power and energy storage. As BBB is already constrained by the size of the yard and facilities from which it operates, a feasibility and transition analysis would need to be conducted to inform staff and stakeholders on best practices and how to ensure that service delivery to BBB’s 54,000 daily customers remains consistent.",
          "Other challenges and critical areas that need to be reviewed prior to transition to an all-electric fleet include: training of mechanic staff on new fleet propulsion technology; route specific energy analysis; impacts of a replacement analysis greater that one-to-one for electric buses; and the evaluation of electric bus technology advancements and reduced battery costs that are hard to accurately predict. While these challenges exist, there are many opportunities for growth of BBB’s understanding of electric bus technology.",
          "BBB Transition Plan",
          "Understanding the unknowns, benefits, costs, tradeoffs, and the City’s desire to move toward an all-electric fleet, staff continues to responsibly and conscientiously prepare and plan for that transition.",
          "To address the electric bus fleet and new infrastructure costs, staff continues to seek additional funding for both, applying for new federal and state programs for this technology, as well as meeting with SCE to learn about their new programs. As mentioned earlier, a TIRCP grant has been submitted to partially fund up to ten new electric vehicles. BBB anticipates announcement of successful grant applications by May 2018. Previous grant submittals for FTA LoNo funding and Bus and Bus Infrastructure Program funding were not successful. Staff has scheduled a conference call with FTA staff on 4/20/18 to discuss our recent grant submittals and how to improve future grant applications.",
          "Staff continues to work with American Public Transportation Association, California Transit Association and sister agencies to maintain the pulse and knowledge of the market. Locally, staff has joined the LA Regional Electric Bus Working Group to collaboratively work with our peers to find solutions for implementation and to the increased costs of this technology. Staff is also working on the Zero Emission Bus Procurement Committee to provide input to the State Department of General Services (DGS) for the creation of a statewide electric bus procurement, giving us options to buy our buses as funding comes in. Additionally, we are in dialogue with Southern California Edison (SCE) to layout plans and estimate costs for converting our property to support a 100% electric fleet. In those conversations, we have learned of SCE’s work with the CPUC for potential funding for infrastructure. We would continue to monitor all funding possibilities.",
          "Finally, BBB has initiated a collaborative effort with FTA, Gillig and the Honolulu Transit System to test one of Gillig’s five total prototype battery electric buses that they are building at the end of this calendar year. In June or early July 2018, staff will recommend to council procurement of one prototype electric bus. This pilot project would help BBB immediately begin to evaluate the technology and the application of operating an electric bus within our service area and how it would impact our operations as we transition to an electric fleet.",
          "Following best practices, we would perform route, charge and rate modeling to better prepare for a future implementation plan. This process would ultimately help staff understand the differences of this technology and how best to procure, deploy and operate electric buses into the BBB fleet mix. Staff would continue efforts with our funding partners to apply for grants to fund electric bus purchases.",

The project design was generally well-received with the ARB expressing support of the project massing and acknowledging that the location of the new mixed-use project is challenging due to the site configuration and topography. While the ARB was positive regarding the overall direction of the project, there were some concerns expressed regarding certain aspects of the design. Staff expressed similar concerns with the overall project design and met with the applicant to convey these concerns. While the applicant responded to some of the ARB and staff comments, there were several other substantive design comments provided by the Architectural Review Board that were not addressed. In particular, the design strategy along the Lincoln Boulevard frontage is one of a repetition of forms and the pedestrian orientation of the Wilson and Ashland elevations should be improved. The project site combines six parcels and the design strategy results in a dramatic difference with the context and existing development pattern. Some variation along the length of Lincoln Boulevard is essential for the project’s compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood.",
          "In approving the project, the Planning Commission included the ARB’s recommendations with respect to modulation, pedestrian orientation, and materiality as conditions of approval. These are areas that will be of particular focus in the ARB’s formal design review should Council approve the DRP.",
          "Planning Commission Action",
          "On January 10, 2018, a public hearing was held by the Planning Commission to consider the DRP. Public testimony was generally in opposition to the project, citing traffic related impacts, size and scale of the project and overall compatibility with surrounding neighborhood. In approving the project, the Commission noted the following:",
          "· The project is consistent with the vision set forth in the LUCE and Zoning Ordinance for housing projects that are located on Commercial Boulevard corridors but that also protect neighborhood character.",
          "· The project adds critical uses to the site and the proposed housing is of appropriate size and scale.",
          "· The project fails to address the context and compatibility of massing along Lincoln and that the façade needs to provide more visual breaks and separating the facades into different volumes; and",
          "· The irregular shape and size of the project site pose challenges for site design.",
          "The Commission took formal action on the DRP on January 10, 2018. A majority of the Planning Commission initially considered recommending that the project be continued to allow further work by the developer on design-related issues prior to approval. However, due to Permit Streamlining Act timelines and the applicant’s unwillingness to grant an extension of time for the Planning Commission to act, the Planning Commission voted 5-2 to approve the project, with amendments to Condition #1 in the Planning Commission’s Statement of Official Action (Attachment B).",
          "Condition #1(a-f) required the ARB to pay particular attention to the following design elements:",
          "· Building façade along Lincoln appears monotonous. The design should be revised to provide additional variation and visual breaks in the building volume, especially on the upper levels throughout the project, with particular attention to variation along the Lincoln Boulevard frontage without lowering the housing density and unit mix to extent possible;",
          "· Street elevations along Ashland and Wilson should be revised for improved pedestrian-orientation by bringing the unit floor lines closer to the street elevation, more modulation and openness to the street;",
          "· Introduction of more materials and color in reference ranges which could lead to better granularity;",
          "· Provide a pedestrian-oriented design along Lincoln by, for example, providing a canopy above the door that can provide a place for retail signage and help differentiate the ground floor commercial from the residential units above and the ground floor residential entrance;",
          "· Revise the planting areas to provide more usable space and space for gathering; and",
          "· Minimize upper level circulation to increase light and air into courtyard",
          "The City Council Draft Statement of Official Action (STOA) (Attachment A) includes this recommendation as Condition #1(a-f).",
          "Discussion",
          "The proposed project is 4-story (36 feet) in height and has a 1.81 floor area ratio (FAR). The project exceeds the maximum Tier 1 limits (3 stories (36 feet) / 1.5 FAR) for the GC zoning district for projects consisting of 100% residential uses above the ground floor that include on-site affordable housing in compliance with the minimum requirements of the Affordable Housing Production Program (AHPP). The project complies with all development standards applicable to the site and is within the established maximums to qualify as a Tier 2 project (36 feet / 2.0 FAR) with on-site affordable housing provided.",
          "Development Review Permit",
          "Pursuant to SMMC 9.40.050, in order to approve a DRP, Council on appeal must make the following findings in an affirmative manner:",
          "A.The physical location, size, massing, setbacks, pedestrian orientation, and placement of proposed structures on the site and the location of proposed uses within the project are consistent with applicable standards and are both compatible and relate harmoniously to surrounding sites and neighborhoods;",
          "B.The rights-of-way can accommodate autos, bicycles, pedestrians, and multi-modal transportation methods, including adequate parking and access;",
          "C.The health and safety services (police, fire etc.) and public infrastructure (e.g., utilities) are sufficient to accommodate the new development;",

          "According to Chapter 9.23 of the Zoning Ordinance, projects that exceed the maximum height or FAR allowed for Tier 1 projects are required to provide the community benefits outlined in subsection 9.23.030 of the Chapter. The purpose of the community benefits is to ensure that projects are allowed to exceed the base height and FAR of a respective zoning district, and in return provide community benefits that enhance the City’s community character.",
          "The project provides the required community benefits identified in Chapter 9.23 (Community Benefits) of the Zoning Ordinance for Tier 2 projects. This includes at least 50% more affordable housing units than would be required by Section 9.64.050 (Affordable Housing Production Program) of the Zoning Ordinance, and a unit mix of at least 15% 3-BR units, at least 20% 2-BR units, and no more than 15% Studio units. Also, the average number of bedrooms for all of the affordable housing units in a Tier 2 project shall be equal to or greater than the average number of bedrooms for all of the market rate units in the project. Further, the project provides the augmented fees and TDM requirements established in Chapter 9.23 of the Zoning Ordinance.",
          "The project is located in the General Commercial land use designation in the LUCE. The development parameters in the LUCE are implemented in the Zoning Ordinance for Tier 2 projects. The proposed project complies with all of the development standards outlined in the Zoning Ordinance.",
          "The proposed development is also consistent with the goals, objectives and policies in the LUCE. Specifically, Goal B25 (Lincoln Boulevard Goals and Policies) seeks redevelopment of Lincoln Boulevard as a district and visually-cohesive mixed-use commercial boulevard. Specifically, Policy B25.5 encourages a lively streetscape with places for people to socialize, where gathering spaces and plazas are encouraged and Policy B25.9 encourages that new mixed-use buildings adjacent to residential districts are contained within a prescribed building envelope that steps down toward the residential district to maintain access to light and air. Additionally, the project is consistent with Policy B25.10, which seeks to limit ground floor uses to mostly active retail with generally continuous, transparent (non-tinted) display windows facing the sidewalks and Policy B25.11 which encourages mixed-use projects to have active ground floor uses that face the boulevard with residential uses located on the upper floors.",
          "The proposed project complies with these goals and policies in that it is a mixed-use building with ground floor commercial that is inviting for pedestrians and activated by the transparent storefront glazing system and plaza along Lincoln Boulevard, while also providing and maintaining access to light and air to the neighboring residential properties by having the building step down from the rear (east) to the street facing side (west). Additionally, the project consists of active retail on the ground floor and residential uses on the upper floors that feature significant common and private outdoor areas.",
          "Housing Accountability Act (HAA)",
          "Under the Housing Accountability Act (Government Code section 65589.5(j)), when a proposed housing development project complies with applicable, objective general plan, zoning, and subdivision standards and criteria, including design review standards, in effect at the time that the housing development project's application is determined to be complete, but a local agency proposes to disapprove the project or to impose a condition that the project be developed at a lower density, the local agency must base its decision upon written findings supported by evidence on the record that both of the following conditions exist:",
          "“(A) The housing development project would have a specific, adverse impact upon the public health or safety unless the project is disapproved or approved upon the condition that the project be developed at a lower density. As used in this paragraph, a “specific, adverse impact” means a significant, quantifiable, direct, and unavoidable impact, based on objective, identified written public health or safety standards, policies, or conditions as they existed on the date the application was deemed complete.",
          "(B) There is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the adverse impact identified, other than the disapproval of the housing development project or the approval of the project upon the condition that it be developed at a lower density.”",
          "Therefore, if after consideration of all written and oral evidence presented to the City Council at the public hearing for the Project, the Council desires to either disapprove or impose a condition that the Project be developed at a lower density, Council must make the above referenced findings and direct staff to incorporate such findings and/or conditions into the STOA. The term “lower density” includes any conditions that have the same effect or impact on the ability of the project to provide housing.",
          "The Housing Accountability Act does not prevent Council from imposing conditions of approval that do not result in lower density; however, if Council imposes conditions of approval that it believes does not result in lower density, it should clarify on the record (i) the factual basis for imposing the conditions and (ii) why Council believes these conditions will not result in lower density.",

The appellant’s appeal statement (Attachment G) raises many specific points as to why the appeal should be approved and DRP 16ENT-0034 denied by Council. In summary, the appeal statement raises concerns regarding: (1) the public comment and hearing process, (2) consistency with the LUCE, (3) compliance with the Zoning Ordinance, (4) application of the Housing Accountability Act (HAA), (5) compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act, (6) traffic impacts, (7) construction impacts, and (8) concerns about CIM Group.",
          "Appeal Analysis",
          "Staff has reviewed the issues raised by the appellant’s Statement of Appeal and provides the following analysis and responses:",
          "1. Public Hearing Process",
          "A. The appellant states that the Brown Act was violated because the supplemental staff report was posted the day of the public hearing.",
          "The agenda for the January 10, 2018 Planning Commission meeting was posted at least 72 hours in advance of the meeting. The Brown Act does not require posting of staff reports (or supplemental staff reports); however, the City provides staff reports for the public’s benefit along with the posting of the agenda and did so for this meeting. The supplemental Planning Commission staff report was provided in direct response to a request received from a Planning Commissioner prior to the hearing. The Commissioners requested that staff explain the applicability of the Housing Accountability Act (HAA) to the review of the project. As a result, the supplemental staff report was issued providing background on the HAA.",
          "B. The appellant states that the staff report contained errors and that the project should have been denied based on oral and written testimony.",
          "The Planning Commission approved the DRP based on the findings set forth in the Planning Commission STOA as well as the oral and written testimony presented prior to or during the public hearing. Council reviews the project de novo. Staff recommends approval of the DRP based on the findings set forth in the draft STOA.",
          "C. The appellant states that the public was not sufficiently apprised of the project or offered sufficient opportunity for public comment. Specifically: the “Santa Monica system of neighbors meeting with developers is deeply flawed” and “Planning staff did not subsequently advise neighbors about the ramifications of possible design changes.”",
          "Although not required as part of the application review process, staff strongly encourages project applicants to conduct neighborhood meetings with affected neighborhood groups and to keep them up to date on project revisions and status. The applicant stated that they presented the project to the Friends of Sunset Park Association on September 15, 2016 and July 10, 2017 and to the Ocean Park Association on November 11, 2016 and June 12, 2017. The applicant further stated that they conducted a full design presentation (including updates) at both meetings. The circulation change to move primary access to Lincoln Boulevard instead of Ashland Avenue was informed predominantly by staff’s review of existing conditions in addition to concerns expressed by residents early in the process. Staff worked extensively with the applicant to re-design the project’s circulation and access in order to minimize impacts on Ashland Avenue.",
          'D. The Planning Commission staff report erroneously stated that "staff had not received any comments or concerns from the public at the time the staff report was being drafted."',
          "At the time the Planning Commission staff report was drafted, staff had not received any comments from the public regarding the project. Staff did not receive any written correspondence from either Friends of Sunset Park Association or Ocean Park Association until after the required public notices were delivered. Once received, all written correspondence was presented to the Planning Commission prior to the public hearing. The Planning Commission also received public testimony during the hearing. Staff accepts public input at any time during the project review process and if requested will provide updates to nearby neighborhood groups and residents.",
          "2. Consistency with the LUCE",
          "A. Appellant states that the project is inconsistent with LUCE guidelines related to General Commercial, Quality of Life, Design Compatibility, Building Articulation, and Building Facades and Step Backs, as well as LUCE goals and policies.",
          "The project complies with all of the LUCE goals and policies listed by the appellant:",
          "· LUCE, pg. 2.1-42-(General Commercial): This appears to be a typo and should read 2.1-39. The building complies with the maximum allowable height of 36 feet adjacent to the property line along the boulevard or the intersecting side street as measured from the midpoint of Segmented Average Natural Grade (SANG).",
          "· LU 1.3 Quality of Life; Goal LU 1: This goal and land use policy states to preserve neighborhood quality of life and protect neighborhoods against potential impacts related to development, traffic, noise, air quality, and encroachment of commercial activities and establish standards that transition down the building envelope of commercial buildings adjacent to residential properties. The proposed building and project site complies with all Tier 2 development standards as outlines in SMMC Section 9.11.030. Additionally, it will also have to comply with all conditions of approval, which address traffic, noise and air quality. Lastly, the building envelope complies with the Daylight Plane Adjacent to Residential Districts (SMMC Section 9.11.030(D)).",
          "· LU 1.5 Design Compatibility; Goal LU1: This goal requires that all new infill development be compatible with existing scale, mass and character of the residential neighborhood. New buildings should transition in size, height, and scale toward adjacent residential structures. As stated previously, the project has imposed conditions of approval for the ARB to review (Condition #1) in that it requires the applicant to revise the size, massing and placement of the proposed structure as well as determining whether the proposed siting and design is compatible to the surrounding area.",
          "· LU 15.8 Building Articulation and LU 15.11 Building Façades and Step Backs:  The buildings articulation and façades provide additional setbacks and stepbacks on the upper floors and provides a 5 foot average on the street facing façade on Lincoln consistent with SMMC 9.11.030. Further, any other articulation required will be reviewed by the ARB as well as ensuring that highly reflective materials will be avoided and that the building massing and design as viewed form the public sidewalks and roadways will allow enough light, air and sense of openness along all facades.",
          "Further, staff has identified additional LUCE goals and policies, specifically, Goal B25 (Lincoln Boulevard Goals and Policies) seeks redevelopment of Lincoln Boulevard as a district and visually-cohesive mixed-use commercial boulevard. In addition, Policy B25.5 encourages a lively streetscape with places for people to socialize, where gathering spaces and plazas are encouraged and Policy B25.9 encourages that new mixed-use buildings adjacent to residential districts are contained within a prescribed building envelope that steps down toward the residential district to maintain access to light and air. The project is consistent with Policy B25.10, which seeks to limit ground floor uses to mostly active retail with generally continuous, transparent (non-tinted) display windows facing the sidewalks and Policy B25.11 which encourages mixed-use projects to have active ground floor uses that face the boulevard with residential uses located on the upper floors.",
          "3. Compliance with the Zoning Ordinance",
          "A. The appellant states, “Setbacks are inaccurately defined in the staff report: Page 24 states “No (required) interior side yard setback.” The appellant references Section 9.11.030 Development Standards, Height limit 32’ (36’ if on-site affordable housing provided); Minimum Interior Side and Rear-Adjacent to Residential District, 10’.”",
          "The Planning Commission staff report erroneously stated that no interior setback is required. Notwithstanding this typographical error, the project was fully reviewed and found to be compliant with all applicable Zoning Ordinance development standards. The project provides a 10’ setback at both the interior side and rear yards. Further, the building height does not exceed 36’ as measured from SANG.",
          "B. The appellant states, “The maximum height for Tier 2 projects in the GC zone is clear: 36 feet. There is not a special condition allowing building on sloped lots to exceed that height through creative grade calculations. The staff report refers to the project as a 36-foot four story building (pg.1) a five story building (pgs.28 and 30) and a 3 story building (pg.1 CEQA Exemption checklist). Front to rear yard is shown in the staff report using the segmented average natural grade calculation. The side yard grade is steep, yet there is no indication of the side yard slope formulation to prove its inapplicability. Additionally, the sites steep east/west grade is possibly compromised due to the adjacent 10 unit CIM Group project under construction which is virtually unmentioned in the staff report. Lastly, the actual height of the building at the corner of Ashland and Lincoln is 45’-8” (as stated by the applicant upon questioned by the Planning Commission) which is not mentioned in the text body of the staff report. However, pages 1, 8, 12, 16, 20, 23, 24 and 28 refer to (either/both) a 4-story building with a maximum height of 36 feet. There is one instance where the building is referred to as approximately 36 feet.” The appellant references Section 9.04.050(B)(2) Measuring Building Height on Sloped Parcels, Sloped Parcels, Side to Side.",
          "The reference to a five-story building in the Planning Commission STOA was a typographical error. Staff has revised the STOA accordingly to reflect the project as a 36-feet, four story building. Further, staff determined the building height to be in compliance utilizing the SANG height methodology (SMMC 9.04.050 (A)(2)). SANG is measured from the elevation levels of three equal segments between the front setback line and rear setback line. As shown in Figure 3, the three equal segments shall be created by drawing imaginary lines connecting opposite side setback lines (or parcel lines if no setbacks are required) at 1/3 increments of the depth of the parcel from the front setback line to the rear setback line (or parcel lines if no setbacks are required). The elevation for the front 1/3 segment shall be equal to the elevation of the midpoint of the front setback line (or parcel line if no setback is required). The elevation for the rear 1/3 segment shall be equal to the elevation of the midpoint of the rear setback line (or parcel line if no setback is required). The elevation of the middle 1/3 segment shall equal the halfway elevation between the front and rear 1/3 segments.",
          "Figure 3: Segmented Average Natural Grade Height Methodology",
          "On sheet A1 of the project plans (Attachment C), the SANG diagrams are provided to show compliance with the determined building height methodology. All elevation points used are derived from the survey prepared on February 14, 2016, prior to the adjacent 10-unit project commencing construction in September of 2016. The height of the building (45’-8”) stated by the appellant is measured from finished ground floor elevation. However, pursuant to the SANG height measurement methodology in the Zoning Ordinance, building height is measured from the mid-point front yard elevation, which is fully compliant at a height of 36 feet.",
          'C. The appellant references Section 9.11.010(D) Purpose. Establish design standards that improve the visual quality of development and create a unified, distinctive, and attractive character along commercial and mixed-use corridors. The appellant states, “This is subjective and therefore a legally vulnerable directive under HAA. The city will lose control of "look" without more specificity in the code if they continue to set HAA ahead of our General Plan and Zoning Ordinance in the review process. Based on the majority of responses of the public and the Planning Commissioners at the hearing on January 10th, 2018, and also members of the ARB at the "float-up", this project doesn\'t meet the bar due to mass, density, and design relevance to the surrounding neighborhoods (even bordering R1), as well as increasing traffic through the neighborhood.”',
          "The appellant is referencing one of the purposes of the Mixed-Use and Commercial Districts in the zoning ordinance. The City is required by state law to comply with the provisions of the HAA. In accordance with recently adopted state legislation, which became effective on January 1, 2018, a local agency’s failure to comply with the HAA may result in civil penalties in the minimum amount of $10,000 per housing unit in the development project (multiplied by a factor with potentially higher penalties for “bad faith” determinations). The recent changes to state law also modified the judicial standard of review to be less deferential to local agency determinations as well as expedited judicial review. Notwithstanding these recent changes to the HAA, the HAA does not define or set the standards for development and therefore, does not impose any independent development standards that would supersede the General Plan and Zoning Ordinance and the LUCE. Any new housing development project must still comply with all City standards and criteria as established by the City’s Municipal Code and the LUCE. The project complies with all applicable development standards in the zoning ordinance and meets the required Development Review Permit findings. Particular design concerns have been included as conditions for the ARB to review as part of its formal design review of the project.",
          'D. The appellant references Section 9.11.030(E) Purpose. Provide appropriate buffers and transition standards between commercial and residential uses to preserve both commercial and mixed-use feasibility and residential quality and provide a sensitive transition between the commercial uses and neighboring residences. The appellant states, “Despite the minimal setbacks imposed on the project, the applicant and planning staff feel comfortable placing a large transformer (a rear yard use) on Wilson Place in what should be the buffering setback to an R1 district where all other uses on that street are beautiful street frontage of single family residences. While this has been constructed by planning staff to be the "rear yard" of the site, its effect is as a side yard. This placement conflicts with the intention of…Item #24 in Conditions of Approval (pg. 38 of the Staff Report) under Final Design: No gas or electric meters shall be located within the required front or street side yard setback areas. This project fails lot size (lot depth) conformity standards if the front yard were Lincoln. However, the Staff report refers to the Lincoln "side yard" as frontage. Can this project have a front yard on Ashland, but a Lincoln address and driveway access? Making Wilson Place the "rear yard" isn\'t consistent with how the rest of that street is developed. Planning staff "cherry picks" the code to advantage the developer, and to the detriment of the surrounding R1 and R2 neighborhoods and streets.”',
          "Pursuant to SMMC Section 9.04.110, the project site is defined as a corner lot. As a result, the narrowest dimension of the parcel with street front is considered the front, which is Ashland Avenue. The rear is opposite the front (Wilson Place) and the remainder of the parcel lines are considered sides (Lincoln Boulevard and interior side). Due to the site’s configuration and placement along Lincoln Boulevard, the defined front yard is Ashland, street side yard is Lincoln and rear yard is Wilson Place. This is consistent with the prevailing streetscape along Ashland and Wilson where either front yards or rear yards of neighboring properties are located. The address of the property is not relevant in determining the front of a parcel.",
          "The placement of the proposed transformer is within the required rear yard setback which is permitted by Code. The transformer pad will be screened by a masonry wall and also be landscaped to provide additional buffering subject to the review and approval of the ARB. Further, per Condition #24, there are no utility meters proposed in either the front or street side yard setback areas.",
          "E. The appellant references Section 9.40.010 (A and D) Purpose: A Development Review Permit is intended to allow the construction of certain projects for which the design and siting could result in an adverse impact on the surrounding area. The permit allows for: A) Review of the location, size, massing, and placement of the proposed structure on the site; D) A determination of whether the proposed siting and design should be permitted by weighing the public need for the benefit to be derived from the proposed site plan use against the impact which it may cause. The appellant states, “Again, the original Staff Report suggested topics and design strategies for discussion; the Supplemental Staff Report effectively annihilated that option.”",
          "The Supplemental Staff Report was provided for clarification/informational purposes and to explain the applicability of the Housing Accountability Act. It did not change any of the analysis of the Development Review Permit in the original staff report, background on design comments, and the staff recommendation. Before voting to approve the project, the Commission held a public hearing including opportunity for public testimony and deliberations on the project. All of the information presented in the original and supplemental staff report was considered. In its approval of the project, the Planning Commission included project specific conditions (Condition #1) for the ARB to pay particular attention in its review of the project. These conditions addressed both SMMC Sections 9.40.010(A) and (D) in that it requires the applicant to revise the design of the proposed structure for additional variation, pedestrian orientation, and materiality. The ARB has purview to review the design of the project, including the areas highlighted by the Commission’s design conditions.",
          "3. Application of the Housing Accountability Act (HAA)",
          "A. Appellant states that the HAA should not have been applied to this project and that application of the HAA dissuaded consideration of public comment.",
          "The HAA is a state law, applicable to charter cities, that precludes the Planning Commission or Council from denying, reducing the density of, or making infeasible any housing development project that complies with objective general plan, zoning, and subdivision standards and criteria (collectively, “Objective Standards”) in effect at the time that the project application is deemed complete unless specific findings of adverse impact are made. Amendments to the HAA, effective January 1, 2018, significantly increased the burden of proof for local agencies to disapprove housing projects or approve projects at lower densities and added civil penalties and other punitive measures to ensure compliance with the HAA.",
          'As explained in the body of the Planning Commission staff report for 16ENT-0034 (Attachment D), staff has recommended approval of the Project based upon its determination that the Project is consistent with objective zoning and General Plan standards, subject to the applicant\'s compliance with all conditions in the City Council Statement of Official Action ("STOA"), which is attached to the staff report (Attachment A). The Planning Commission approved the project because no oral or written evidence was presented at the public hearing identifying “specific, adverse impacts” as defined in the HAA.',
          "Appellant states that the Planning Commission should have determined whether the project met the criteria for a Development Review Permit before applying the provisions of the HAA. In accordance with the most recent HAA amendments, however, “a housing development project . . . shall be deemed consistent, compliant, and in conformity with an applicable plan, policy, ordinance, standard, requirement, or other similar provision if there is substantial evidence that would allow a reasonable person to conclude that the housing development project is consistent, compliant, or in conformity.” [Government Code Section 65589.5(f)(4)] Staff’s determination is that this Tier 2 Project is consistent with “Objective Standards” as defined by the HAA.",
          "As discussed above, Council may approve this project pursuant to the staff recommendation by making the affirmative findings set forth in the STOA without consideration of the HAA. Should Council choose to deny or reduce density of this project, findings of “specific, adverse impacts” as set forth in the HAA would be required.",
          "5.  Compliance with California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)",
          "A. Appellant states that streamlining CEQA conditions for housing amplifies the detrimental effects of traffic; that the CEQA exemption criteria set forth in Section 21155.1 were not met; that the Planning Commission did not conduct a public hearing regarding the CEQA exemption as required by Section 21155.1; and that the draft EIR for the LUCE should have been consulted before an exemption was claimed.",
          "CEQA and its streamlining provisions established in Public Resources Code (PRC) 21155.1 were enacted by the State Legislature (specifically SB 375 effective January 1, 2009). As a lead agency, the City must review discretionary projects in compliance with the regulatory provisions of CEQA. The full text of PRC 21155.1 is attached (Attachment F).",
          "On January 10, 2018, the Planning Commission held a public hearing to consider approval of the project and determined that the Project met the applicable requirements of PRC 21155.1 and is considered a project to be statutorily exempt from CEQA. Public input given at the public hearing was considered by the Planning Commission in their decision-making.",
          "The Project meets the applicable requirements of a Transit Priority Project under PRC 21155.1 and is considered a project to be statutorily exempt from CEQA. No EIR, either project-level or program level, is required. CEQA Guidelines Section 15168 establishes the guidelines for when a Program EIR is being prepared for a project and for when a subsequent project may rely on the use of a Program EIR for CEQA compliance. CEQA Guidelines Section 15168 does not apply to the 2903 Lincoln Boulevard Project since a Program EIR is not required for the project - nor is a Program EIR being relied on for CEQA compliance.",
          "6. Traffic Impacts",
          "A. Appellant states that traffic impacts of the project should have been further studied pursuant to CEQA and in conjunction with the Lincoln Neighborhood Corridor Plan (LiNC).",
          "As detailed in the CEQA Exemption Checklist prepared for the project, the Project meets the applicable requirements of Public Resources Code Section 21155.1 and is considered a Transit Priority Project to be statutorily exempt from CEQA. Unlike categorical exemptions the statutory exemption for a transit priority project is absolute. A statutory exemption applies to any given project that falls under its definition. Therefore, since the 2903 Lincoln Blvd Project qualifies for a statutory exemption, a traffic study is not required. Further, the appellant raises concerns regarding existing traffic conditions, which have not been created by the proposed project. Based on staff’s review of existing conditions that were raised early in the project review process, the project’s circulation design was substantially revised to minimize potential impacts to Ashland Avenue.",
          "Regarding existing conditions, the City is currently undertaking efforts to address existing traffic conditions through the Sunset Park Neighborhood Traffic Management Program. Several options are being studied as part of this program but generally, any Sunset Park street that is not signalized and intersects with Lincoln will be evaluated to possible changes to restrict either commute period flows or permanent directional (one-way) closures.",
          "Staff was aware of the potential traffic impacts on Lincoln and ensured the project plans were fully reviewed for compliance with the Lincoln Neighborhood Corridor Plan (LiNC). At the Planning Commission public hearing, staff further discussed and clarified to the Planning Commission how the proposed LiNC plans will coordinate with the project and discussed potential ramifications for circulation and ingress/egress to the site. The applicant is fully aware of the existing conditions, including the peak hour bus lanes, and will have to accommodate for these conditions as well as planned future improvements adjacent to the project site. It was presented at the meeting that the planned medians in the LiNC plan will limit (or restrict) the ability for southbound drivers to turn east across Lincoln into the project site. Instead, southbound drivers will be able to U-turn at Marine in order to access the project. Northbound drivers exiting the project wanting to go southbound will be able to U-turn at Ashland or further north, if necessary. Staff is also aware of the existing conditions on both Ashland Avenue and Wilson Place. Ashland has parking on both sides of the street with the streetscape interrupted by multiple driveways. Wilson has restricted access from Lincoln with only northbound right turns permitted from Wilson Place. Due to the number of curb cuts already existing on Ashland Avenue and concerns regarding existing traffic conditions voiced by residents, it was determined that the proposed site access from Lincoln Boulevard would help off-load traffic and minimize the project’s impacts on Ashland Avenue.",
          "7.  Construction Impacts",
          "A. Appellant states that construction impacts of the project should have been studied further.",
          "The project will be required to submit a construction mitigation plan in accordance with Condition #88 of the City Council STOA (Attachment A). As part of this plan the applicant will be required to indicate the location of staging of equipment, anticipated truck routes, number of trucks, and a construction period parking plan, which shall not be permitted to use public streets. The approved mitigation plan shall be posted on the site for the duration of the project construction and shall be produced upon request. This plan has not yet been submitted since it is required prior the issuance of a building permit.",
          "As stated prior, the 2903 Lincoln Boulevard Project meets the applicable requirements of PRC 21155.1 and is considered a project to be statutorily exempt from CEQA. Statutory exemptions are projects specifically excluded from CEQA consideration as defined by the State Legislature. Therefore, no traffic study was required.",
          "8. Concerns About CIM Group",
          "A. The appellant states that the project should not have been approved because Planning Director David Martin was Vice President of the CIM Group from 1999 to 2009.",
          "Planning Director David Martin has not worked for or received income from CIM Group since he left the company in 2009 and therefore does not have financial interest in CIM Group.",
          "B. The appellant states that CIM Group is presently constructing its 10-unit 2919 Lincoln/802 Ashland project on the hill behind the 2903 Lincoln site. They do not follow the rules, and they disrespect neighbors.",
          "The City takes seriously all complaints about rule violations. Concerns about construction at another site, however, are not properly the subject of this appeal but rather should be referred by concerned community members to the City’s Building and Safety Division, which handles all on-going construction projects for compliance with construction rules and regulations.",
          "Environmental Status",
          "The proposed four-story mixed use building is exempt from the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) pursuant to Section 21155.1 of the CEQA Guidelines, which exempts a special class of Transit Priority Project (TPP) determined to be a Sustainable Communities Project (SCP) by the local jurisdiction. As provided, the proposed project meets all of the following requirements set forth in Section 21155.1 as a Sustainable Communities Project:",
          "1. The project is consistent with the general land use designation, density, building, intensity, and policies in the Southern California Association of Governments’ adopted Sustainable Communities Strategy.",
          "2. The project is at least 50 percent residential use based on area and greater than 0.75 FAR.",
          "3. The project is at least 20 units/acre.",
          "4. The project is located within ½ mile of a major transit stop or high quality transit corridor included in SCAG’s Regional Transportation Plan.",
          "5. The project can be adequately served by existing utilities and the project applicant will pay in-lieu or development fees.",
          "6. The project will not impact wetlands or other biological species.",
          "7. The project site is not located on a list of hazardous waste sites compiled pursuant to Section 65962.25 of Government Code.",
          "8. The project site has been subject to a preliminary endangerment assessment to determine the existence of any release of hazardous substance on the site and to determine the potential for exposure to significant health hazards.",
          "9. The project will not have an impact on historical resources.",
          "10. The project site is not subject to wildland fire hazards, high fire risk or explosion, risk of a public health exposure, seismic risk, or landslide or flood hazard.",
          "11. The project site is not located on developed open space.",
          "12. The project is 15 percent more efficient than Title 24 standards and using 25 percent less water than the regional average household.",
          "13. The project site is less than 8 acres.",
          "14. The project is less than 200 units.",
          "15. The project will not result in any net loss in the number of affordable housing units.",
          "16. The project does not include any single level building exceeding 75,000 sf.",
          "17. The project will incorporate any applicable mitigation measure or performance standards adopted in the prior LUCE EIR.",
          "18. The project would not conflict with nearby operating industrial uses, as the operations of existing industrial uses nearby will not be impacted.",
          "19. The project site is located within ½ mile of a rail station included in the RTP or within ¼ mile of a High Quality Transit Corridor included in the RTP.",
          "20. The project meet the requirement that at least five percent of the housing will be available to very-low-income households for at least 55 years.",
          "Therefore, based on the above, the proposed project is considered a Sustainable Communities Project that is exempt from CEQA pursuant to Section 21155.1.",
          "Alternative Actions",
          "As an alternative to the staff recommendation, Council may choose to approve the appeal based on revised findings and deny the DRP (16ENT-0034). However, in order to do so, Council would be required to make additional findings under the Housing Accountability Act, as stated in this report.",
          "Financial Impacts and Budget Actions",
          "There is no immediate financial impact or budget action required as a result of the recommended action."

          "Introduction and First Reading of an Ordinance Modifying Sections of the Santa Monica Municipal Code Related to the Management of Parking and Adoption of a Resolution Revising Public Parking Rates",
        department: "Parking Operations (PCD)",
        body: [
          "Executive Summary",
          "This report presents information and requests actions necessary to adopt the revised Downtown transient parking rates and permit fees following the public hearing held last month.",
          "On March 6, 2018, staff proposed various demand-responsive parking pricing strategies options for Council consideration to further manage congestion, improve public parking services, address Santa Monica residents’ parking desires, and encourage shifts towards more sustainable modes of transportation. Council heard from the public and various stakeholders within the City, and directed staff to return to Council with modifications to the recommended pricing strategy that, in the short term, take into account input from Council and the community, and in the long-term, strategically address the reduction of subsidized parking by providing increased investments in diverse mobility options.",
          "Background",
          "On May 11, 2010, Council adopted a resolution (Attachment C) establishing new parking rates for off-street parking as a first phase in implementing the 2009 Walker Parking Study recommendations. The Walker Parking Study found that there was an imbalance in pricing between the different parking facilities within Downtown resulting in the unintended consequence of putting visitors, employees, and transient and monthly parkers in competition for the most convenient and often least expensive spaces while other spaces in the City remained largely unoccupied. Walker Parking consultants provided recommendations consistent with the LUCE to better manage parking demand and maximize efficiency of the public parking supply in Downtown Santa Monica.",
          "On July 10, 2012, Council adopted a resolution (Attachment D) establishing new parking fees at citywide on-street parking meters, off-street parking facilities, and beach parking lots, including a reduction in the Downtown free parking “grace” period from two hours to 90 minutes. These changes were informed by a parking rate study conducted by Walker Parking Consultants in 2012, consistent with the LUCE and the 2009 Walker Parking Study.",
          "On May 10, 2016, Council adopted a resolution (Attachment E) establishing revised parking rates for the Civic Center and Downtown parking facilities to address increased high weekday occupancies and discourage potential “park and ride” activity due to the arrival of the Expo Light Rail.",
          "Discussion",
          "On March 6, 2018, staff conducted a study session (Attachment F) with City Council that included various demand-responsive parking pricing strategy options for Council consideration. Staff sought Council direction on the concept of implementing a demand-responsive parking pricing strategy that sets different parking rate structures on weekdays and weekends based on their different demand patterns. The proposed parking strategies were based on a detailed analysis of parking transactions and occupancies in each Downtown parking facility, and were designed to:",
          "· Facilitate at least 15% parking availability in all facilities at all times",
          "· Redirect long-term parking sessions to less expensive parking facilities outside of the Downtown core",
          "· Maximize the use of existing public parking inventory",
          "· Address occupancy, traffic, access and circulation challenges",
          "· Encourage consideration of travel mode shift",
          "· Reduce subsidized parking for monthly permit holders",
          "Prior to developing the parking pricing strategies for Council consideration, staff conducted study sessions with various stakeholders throughout the City to ensure that the needs of the communities represented by the respective stakeholders were considered and included in the overall proposal to Council. During this thorough six month outreach process, staff received verbal and written comments from residents and stakeholders in the City that supported staff’s overall proposal to address traffic congestion and excessively high parking facility peak occupancies. However, the feedback on how to address these challenges varied amongst stakeholders. For example, there was unequivocal support from Santa Monica Travel and Tourism, which promotes the City of Santa Monica as a travel destination as well as local employment opportunities in the City, on all of the staff proposed pricing strategies (Attachment G). There were other stakeholders in the City who also supported the overall goals, but recommended addressing the current challenges with varied pricing alternatives, primarily being the preservation of the free parking for the first 90 minutes in the Downtown core parking facilities. Attachment H includes formal written comments from these stakeholders, community members and residents.",
          "In light of the comprehensive discussion and feedback, Council directed staff to return to Council promptly with the necessary ordinance and resolution to adopt the proposed parking rate increases with the following modifications:",
          "Immediate Parking Pricing Strategies",
          "· Maintain first 90 minutes free parking period in PS 1-9 and KEC",
          "· Increase parking rates; however maintain a uniform parking rate structure across Downtown core facilities, PS 1-8 and KEC, to avoid customer confusion",
          "· Eliminate monthly parking in PS 1 and PS 3, providing alternative parking options, if necessary, in PS 9 and PS 10 based on availability",
          "· Draft an ordinance that streamlines the process and modernizes the municipal code to reflect the current practice of setting on-street and off-street parking rates based on goals outlined in the LUCE and DCP",
          "· Continue subsidizing parking for Ken Edwards Center and Santa Monica Emeritus College program users",
          "· Develop new subsidized parking options for Main Library program users",
          "· Continue to invest incremental parking revenues over the FY 2009-10 base year into parking traffic, access, and circulation programs, including transit subsidy options",
          "Staff recommends that Council adopt the attached resolution that includes the immediate parking pricing strategies as submitted for implementation by July 1, 2018. This proposal addresses the immediate implementation of the necessary ordinance and resolution to establish rates in a timely manner.",
          "Long-term Parking Management Strategies",
          "Staff will work with city stakeholders and other City Departments to develop a long-term comprehensive strategy that is aligned with the City’s larger focus on supporting a more livable community, and return to Council on or before June 30, 2019 with specific long term strategy proposals for Council approval and adoption. Among the steps staff will take going forward are the following:",
          "· Partner with City Departments, stakeholders, and TNC businesses to create mobility options that support the use of more sustainable travel modes",
          "· Evaluate the effectiveness of a SM Resident Downtown Access Parking Program and a Downtown Merchant Validation Program",
          "· Work with stakeholders to analyze the feasibility of pursuing a universal valet parking program",
          "· Return to Council with a comprehensive strategy that addresses the reduction of free or subsidized parking with investments in tangible mobility options",
          "· Return to Council annually to report on the State of Citywide Parking",
          "Judicial Council Parking",
          "The fee resolution also extends the bulk parking fee for the California Judicial Council for twelve months from July 2018 to June 2019 in anticipation of the multipurpose sports field, with a possible request for a six month extension if construction demands allow. The Council has made progress in promoting alternative options for its employees, customers, and jurors; however, the Council requires additional time to address budget impacts and to develop programs to address its minimum parking needs, particularly for members of the public who utilize the court’s services.",
          "Financial Impacts and Budget Actions",
          "Due to the ever-changing conditions surrounding current and emerging transportation options and parking alternatives, revenue projections in establishing budgets are as much an art as a science, and predictive models developed by staff to gauge parking revenues fall into this category. The model used to develop the proposed pricing strategy is based on the concept of demand elasticity and recognizes that both occupancy and elasticity changes throughout the day, including research that suggests that elasticities tend to be higher when there are more alternative transportation options.",
          "The proposed parking rate and permit fee adjustments account for parkers shifting amongst the Citywide parking facilities, and takes a proactive approach to managing demand across the remaining parking facilities, slightly increasing the Downtown core parking rates to encourage parkers to shift to less expensive facilities without oversaturating any given facility due to significant rate differential between structures. Lessons learned from the FY 2016-17 parking rate change suggest that not making the secondary rate increase to other peripheral parking facilities within the Downtown portfolio would result in potential overcrowding in those facilities.",
          "Staff believes that the following range between $3 million and $5 million of increased revenues is sound, prudent, and based on an elasticity model that has included several years of data from Santa Monica parking facilities as well as benchmarking against industry standards of practice and in comparison with other parking operations with similar characteristics. While no model will exactly predict total revenues, staff is confident that it has established a fairly strong case for these predicted increases, if the recommendation is approved as submitted for implementation by July 1, 2018. The anticipated revenues would primarily recover the revenues lost over the last 1-2 years due downward trend of parking transactions related to the changing mobility patterns. Staff will include the revenue projections as part of the FY 2018-19 Exception Based Budget, and will continue to actively monitor parking activity in the various facilities and adjust revenue estimates, if necessary, during the FY 2018-19 midyear budget."
