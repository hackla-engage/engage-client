    shortDescription: >-
      A web portal for reviewing local government agendas and acquiring
      community feedback
    longDescription: >
      Engage is a web-based platform that makes it easy to give your feedback to
      your local government. Engage's pilot use case is for the city of Santa
      Monica, CA, USA. Engage retrieves city council agendas using the
      engage-scraper (an affiliated project) and allows users to comment on the
      items. The goal of the engage platform is to make participation more
      equitable for all individuals. Feedback is recorded and documented in
      clickable PDFs (generated by simple-latex, an affiliated project). PDFs
      are available to the public through the Engage web app as well. 
    features:
      - Web form for user feedback
      - PDF generation of collected user feedback
      - Automated email to local governments
